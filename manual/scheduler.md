# Scheduler

One of the most powerful feature offered by MetaTime is the scheduler, user may schedule different tasks / activities by defining the relative time in future from now or absolute Time/DateTime components. One simple example of scheduler usage looks like this:

  [scala type="section" value="scheduler" file="Examples"]
  Above example will schedule the task for 01 May 2016 midnight.
